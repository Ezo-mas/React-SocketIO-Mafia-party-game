              Welcome to Mafia World, a thrilling online game we created as part of a university project. This game is the result of hard work, creativity, and teamwork from me and my classmates. We wanted to bring the excitement and strategy of the Mafia game genre to life, all while learning and experimenting with game development.

              As university students, we've put our skills to the test, combining our passion for gaming with the knowledge we've gained in class. Every feature, every mechanic, and every character is the product of hours of collaboration, problem-solving, and a shared vision.

              We hope you enjoy playing Mafia World as much as we enjoyed creating it!
